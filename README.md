📚 Library Management System — SQL Project

Welcome to my **Library Management System** project — built entirely using **MySQL**. This project simulates a real-world digital library where books can be issued, returned, and tracked by employees across multiple branches.

---

🚀 Project Overview


This SQL-based project is designed to:

- Manage books, members, employees, and branches
- Track book issuance and returns
- Generate performance reports for branches and employees
- Use stored procedures for business logic like issuing books
- Handle conditions like book availability



🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Database**: MySQL
- **Core Concepts**: Joins, Stored Procedures, Views, Aggregations, Conditional Logic, Grouping, Subqueries



🧾 Features Implemented

🔸 Core Tables:
- `books`: stores book details and availability status
- `members`: contains member information
- `employees`: holds employee data and branch association
- `branch`: stores branch-wise info
- `issued_status`: tracks books issued to members
- `return_status`: logs returned books and condition

🔹 Stored Procedure:
- `issue_book`: Issues a book only if it's available
- Includes custom logic for book availability and user feedback


📊 Reports & Queries:
- Branch performance reports (books issued, returned, revenue)
- Top employees by number of books issued
- Availability check and real-time status
